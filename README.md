PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this Power BI portfolio project, I developed a comprehensive sales performance analysis dashboard tailored for an insurance company. This analysis spans a 5-year period, utilizing a custom-created dataset to provide insights into sales performance, with a financial year running from April to March as per Myanmar's fiscal calendar. The report is structured across five distinct pages, each showcasing different aspects of sales performance.

1. Sales Executive KPIs:

In this section, I provide a detailed analysis of sales executive performance, focusing on the following key metrics:
MTD Sales: A detailed comparison of actual sales versus the current month's target, last month and the same period last year (SPLY). Variance and percentage differences are highlighted to clearly display performance against benchmarks.
YTD Sales: Year-to-date (YTD) sales performance is evaluated against both targets and SPLY, focusing on variance, percentage to target, and sales growth.
Trends: All targets and SPLY are showcased over months, providing a clear view of trends and helping to identify patterns in sales performance.

This page provides a detailed understanding of how sales executives are performing relative to expectations and historical data.

2. Sales Scorecard:

The sales scorecard presents a high-level overview of performance across various dimensions:
Sales Channels: MTD, YTD, and five-year performance metrics are displayed, offering insights into the effectiveness of various sales channels.
Products: An analysis of product performance over these periods helps identify which products are performing well and which are not.
Divisions: Performance of different divisions is highlighted, showcasing their contribution to overall sales over time.

This page is designed to give a snapshot of sales performance across channels, products, and divisions, providing valuable insights for strategic planning.

3. Sales Channel Performance:

This page utilizes a traffic light system to visually represent the performance of each sales channel:

Traffic Light Highlights: Performance is visually represented using red, yellow, and green indicators, showing how each channel measures up against targets and SPLY.

This intuitive system makes it easy to spot which channels are performing well and which require attention.

4. Product Performance:

Detailed analysis of product sales is presented here:

Sales vs. Target: Each product’s sales performance is compared against set targets.
Growth Analysis: Insights into the growth of each product over time.

This page provides a granular view of product performance, helping to pinpoint high-performing and underperforming products.

5. Division Sales PERFORMANCE:

This section focuses on the performance of various sales divisions:

Performance vs. Target: Analysis of each division’s sales performance compared to targets.
Growth Metrics: Evaluation of growth trends within each division.

This page helps assess how well different divisions are meeting their sales targets and contributing to overall growth.

CONCLUSION

This Power BI report offers a detailed and visually engaging analysis of sales performance, utilizing a self-created dataset to provide meaningful insights. Each page is crafted to deliver clarity and actionable information, showcasing my skills in data analysis and visualization.
